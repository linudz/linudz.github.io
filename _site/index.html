      <p><em>Last site update <strong>May 2023</strong></em>. My name is Fabio Barteri and I am a Computational Biologist at the <a href="https://www.barcelonabeta.org/en">Barcelona Beta Brain Research Centre</a> and <a href="https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a>. I work as a Bioinformatics Lab Manager in the group led by Prof. <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcadiNavarro">Arcadi Navarro</a>.</p>

<h1 id="research-interests">Research interests</h1>
<p>My scientific activity revolves aroud the implementation of computational approaches to infer genome-phenome maps from evolutionary data.</p>

<h2 id="convergent-amino-acid-substitutions">Convergent Amino Acid Substitutions</h2>
<p>Amino Acid substitutions that are consistent with phenotype convergence can indicate that the protein is linked to that phenotype. We call these mutations Convergent Amino Acid Substitutions (CAAS). CAAS can represent an important starting point to reconstruct the genetic background of complex traits. At the moment, we are striving to improve our CAAS detection and validation strategy.</p>

<h3 id="caastools-a-toolbox-to-identify-and-test-convergent-amino-acid-substitutions">CAAStools, a toolbox to identify and test Convergent Amino Acid Substitutions</h3>

<p><img src="assets/img/caastools.jpeg" alt="CAAStools" /></p>

<p>In the last years, the lab led by <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcadiNavarro">Arcadi Navarro</a> @ UPF-Barcelona has developed a strategy to identiy, test and validate CAAS in orthologous protein alignments from different mammalian species. In 2023 we released CAAStools, a toolbox written in Python that allows the user to detect and test CAAS.</p>

<p>CAAStools is <a href="https://github.com/linudz/caastools">available in GitHub</a></p>

<p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong></p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="simulation-of-trait-evolution">Simulation of trait evolution.</h2>
<p>Quantitative traits can variate considerably within and between species. Sometimes this variation comes from neutral evolution, sometimes is the consequence of selective pressure.</p>

<h1 id="lab-management">Lab Management</h1>
<p>As a Bioinformatics lab manager in the Navarro’s group, I take care of several aspects of the bioinformatics routine in the lab.</p>

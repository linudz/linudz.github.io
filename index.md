*Last site update **May 2023***. My name is Fabio Barteri and I am a Computational Biologist at the [Barcelona Beta Brain Research Centre](https://www.barcelonabeta.org/en) and [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/). I work as a Bioinformatics Lab Manager in the group led by Prof. [Arcadi Navarro](https://twitter.com/ArcadiNavarro).

Surprising as it may be, the contribution of genetics in determining biological diversity is limited. The staggering diversity of forms and adaptations that we can observe in nature is determined by the concomitant action of genetic and nongenetic factors, such as environmental determination and developmental mechanisms.

**I come from Rome** where I was born and raised. I moved to Barcelona in 2015 for my PhD, and I have been living there ever since.
